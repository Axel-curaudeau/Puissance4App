# Installation

To successfully compile the code, you need to install visual studio 2022 with C++ development tools.
Then, the application can be compiled.

To run the app, you need to copy all the .dll files from the [./opencv/x86/vc17/bin](./opencv/x86/vc17/bin/) folder and from the [./Dobot/bin](./Dobot/bin/)
 to the folder where is your compiled .exe file.

For example, if the app is compiled using the Debug configuration, you need to copy the .dll files to the [./Debug](./Debug/) folder.
